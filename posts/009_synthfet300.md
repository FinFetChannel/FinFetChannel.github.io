SynthFET 3000 is a browser-compatible audio synthesizer and tracker built with Python and Pygame CE. It lets you design custom waveforms, shape envelopes, add some effects, and compose full multi-track songs using an intuitive tracker interface â€” all without writing any code.

Realtime Keyboard Interface Play notes using your computer keyboard or touchscreen, with adjustable octave range.

Waveform Editor Draw your own wave shapes or choose from presets (sine, square, saw, triangle, noise). Smooth and apply them interactively.

Envelope Editor Shape the volume dynamics (ADSR, tremolo, pluck, ramp) over time. Smooth and apply envelopes just like waveforms.

Tracker Module Compose songs using a familiar grid system:
    Multi-track pattern editor
    Per-track instrument selection
    Infinite song length with section navigation
    Adjustable tempo (BPM), pitch range, and export options

Instrument Manager Save and load up to 6 custom instruments. Instantly swap them in or edit live.

Effects Add reverb, overdrive and tremolo with tunable parameters.

Web-Compatible Runs in the browser (via GitHub Pages or Itch.io). Installable as a [Progressive Web App (PWA)](https://finfetchannel.github.io/SynthFET3000/).

Export to WAV Export full songs or individual tracks to .wav files, with separate channels for easy mixing in DAWs like Audacity.
