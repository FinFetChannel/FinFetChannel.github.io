Dead And! is a first-person shooter using Python and Pygame, built from the ground up with a custom raycasting engine. The project was developed incrementally, with each stage documented through devlogs covering floorcasting, wall rendering, sprite animation, looking up/down, enemy AI, sound integration, and UI/menu systems. Features include dynamic environments, interactive enemies, immersive audio, and a playable FPS mode. Recently updated with a web version with **Pygbag**.
