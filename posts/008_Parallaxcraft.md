ParallaxCraft is a creative reinterpretation of Minecraft using purely 2D elements to simulate 3D depth. The game uses layered, pre-rendered 2D voxel tiles arranged from farthest to nearest, with scaling and parallax effects creating convincing depth.

Players can view the world from four fixed camera directions. Smooth shearing transitions simulate camera rotation, enhancing immersion beyond simple orthogonal views. A simple lighting system adds realism, darkening blocks blocked from light by those above, while a moving sun casts dynamic shadows.

This project highlights clever use of 2D rendering techniques and creative problem-solving to mimic 3D gameplay and atmosphere, all built within a manageable codebase.
