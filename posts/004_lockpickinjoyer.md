Cross-platform lock-picking simulation game built with **Python**, **Pygame-CE** and **Pygbag**, inspired by the LockPickingLawyer. Features realistic pin-binding mechanics, tension control, multi-difficulty modes (3â€“6 pins), touch and mouse input, and immersive audio feedback. Implemented asynchronous game loop, dynamic object rotation, scalable UI components, and persistent highscore tracking for performance-based challenges.
