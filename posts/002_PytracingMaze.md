Simple ray tracing game in Python, based on my ray casting project. As you may have guessed, things started to get a bit heavy for Python, so i had to resort to the **Numba** library, improving performance by 100x.
This game uses a simple implementation of raytracing, where several rays are cast for each pixel, this allows for real time shadows and reflections. Geometry is based on math, with cubes and spheres on a grid system.
