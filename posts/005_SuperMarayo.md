A first-person perspective version of Super Mario Bros. using raycasting, made in Python with **PyGame-CE** and **PygBag**.

This project reimagines the 1985 classic Super Mario Bros. as a first-person experience, built entirely in Python and playable directly in the browser via Pygbag. The game currently includes the full first level and its secret underground stage, with all assets and sounds recreated from scratch.

The core rendering uses a raycasting engine adapted for vertical gameplay: instead of drawing wall columns (traditional raycasting), the system renders horizontal lines to simulate stacked blocks, enabling vertical movement and multi-level platforms. A custom physics system handles gravity, jumping, item collection, and enemy movement to replicate the original mechanics from a new perspective.
