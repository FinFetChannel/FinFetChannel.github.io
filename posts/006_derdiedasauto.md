DerDieDas Auto is a browser-playable racing game that teaches German noun genders (der, die, das) through fast-paced, interactive gameplay. Built in Python with Pygame and deployed for the web using Pygbag, it combines arcade mechanics with language learning principles.

Players control a car, switching lanes to match nouns with their correct articles or, in reverse mode, collecting nouns matching the car’s gender. Features include dynamic scaling for depth simulation, streak-based scoring multipliers, mobile and desktop controls, multiple word lists, slow mode, and an adaptive low-graphics mode for performance optimization.

Key technical elements include pixel-perfect collision detection, modular game-state management using Python’s match/case, browser-specific bug handling, and responsive input mapping. The game’s design evolved through iterative user feedback from language learners and the Pygame community, resulting in an accessible, engaging, and educational experience.

Also available for Android via [Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.finfet.dddauto) or as a [PWA](https://finfetchannel.github.io/Derdiedas_Auto/).
