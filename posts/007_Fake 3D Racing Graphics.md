This project demonstrates how to replicate the iconic pseudo-3D visuals of classic racing games using Python. By slicing and scaling a seamless road texture, the illusion of depth and perspective is created on a 2D screen.

Key features include dynamic road curvature and elevation modeled with sine functions, realistic scaling of road slices and sprites based on distance, and smooth side-to-side road movement to simulate car steering. The playerâ€™s car remains stationary at the bottom center, with the road moving beneath to simulate driving.

Additional sprites like other cars and roadside objects are scaled and rendered using a depth buffer to ensure proper layering behind hills and curves.

This project serves as a nice foundation for building retro-style racing games and showcases clever use of 2D techniques to evoke a classic 3D feel.
